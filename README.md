##Cat vs Dog Identifier
#Overview
The Cat vs Dog Identifier project is a machine learning application designed to classify images as either containing a cat or a dog. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in identifying whether an image predominantly features a cat or a dog.

##Requirements
To run the Cat vs Dog Identifier project, you'll need the following:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

##Installation

#Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/TushtiSavarn/cat-vs-dog-identifier.git

#Install the required dependencies:

Download the dataset (e.g., Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset) and place it in the project directory.

##Usage
After installing the dependencies and downloading the dataset, navigate to the project directory.

#Train the model by running:

python train.py
Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify images using:


python predict.py path_to_image

Replace path_to_image with the path to the image you want to classify.

##Dataset

The Cat vs Dog Identifier project uses a dataset containing images of cats and dogs for training and evaluation. You can use any similar dataset or even your own dataset with images of cats and dogs.

##Model

The model architecture used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The final layer is a dense layer with softmax activation, which outputs the probabilities of the image being a cat or a dog.

##Contributing

Contributions to the Cat vs Dog Identifier project are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
